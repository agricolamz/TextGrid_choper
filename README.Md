This Praat script takes a TextGrid file with several labelled sections and extracts every labelled segment into its own TextGrid file (with all labels on the other tiers).

This script is based on [chop_for_alignment.Praat](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/Fall_2013/ling520/chop_soundfile.Praat) by Eric Doty from University of Pennsylvania - Linguistics Department
